# DL-project-image-segmentation

Now, suppose that we want to get where the object is present inside the image, the shape of the object
or which pixel represents what object.
So in cases like this, we have to play with a segment of the image from which I mean to say that we
give a label to each pixel of an image.
The goal of image segmentation is to train a neural network which can return a pixel y's mask of
whatever image we're talking about.the goal is to assign a label or a class to the input image.
